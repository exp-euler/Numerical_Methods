# Runge-Kutta C++ Implementation

Runge-Kutta methods are numerical methods for solving initial value problems.
This repository provides a general implementation of such methods without
focusing in any one in particular. It includes a few methods already implemented
and one can very easily add more methods by only providing their Butcher
Tableaus. [This Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)
article nicely presents the idea behind these methods,
how they are written in terms of a Butcher Tableau as well as provides the
tableaus of some famous RK methods.
